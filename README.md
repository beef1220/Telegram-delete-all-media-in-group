This is a telegram bot for removing all media in group/chat.

# Prerequisite
For group, `Chat History For New Members` setting must configure to `Visible` **at the begining of group conversation starts**. Otherwise the bot cannot obtain chat history and there is no way to delete them. If the setting switch to `Visible` at the middle of conversation, the bot can only remove media after this setting switched.

**Please test before use, if you are having sensitive conversation :)**
